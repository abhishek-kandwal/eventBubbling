event bubbling & event capturing :
=> when we have multiple events registered.
  eg: body>parent(div)>>child1(div),child2(div).
      we have 2-events ,both are clicked event with the div.
      event1- in the parent
              [ console.log("parent") ]
      event2- in the child1
              [ console.log("child1") ]
      
  so, in event Bubbling- { [buttom-element to top]
    - if we click the child1,
      >>> "child1"
      >>> "parent"
    - if we click the parent
      >>> "parent"
    => this is event bubbling first the inner event executes then the outer one.
  }
  
  so, in event capturing- { [top-element to bottom]
    - it becames opposite of bubbling
    - if we click the child1,
      >>> "parent"
      >>> "child"
    - if we click the parent,
      >>> "parent"
  }
